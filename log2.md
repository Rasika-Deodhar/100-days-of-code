# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 02, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started with React JS Course from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

- Why React?
- JSX intro
- Hello World Code
- Functional Components

**Thoughts:** <ins>I am on point 0 of my career</ins>. Nothing is really making any sense. I am not even sure if coding is for me for the rest of my life. I want to become a good problem solver. My mind is completely blocked and I am unable to perform well in my job too. Getting imposter syndrome. This is just a start to give myself a try if I still can improve myself and boost my confidence. Hope I can do better. All the best to me! :)
<ins>This is my second attempt to the challenge, with same situation at the moment. With slight different approach in my routine.</ins>
